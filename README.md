# Fiverr Senpai

[See the site in action here](https://fiverrsenpai.netlify.app/)
## A 2.5 Day Hackathon project
 28 June - 2 July 2021
### Wild Code School in partnership with Fiverr
This project won the web development bracket over a 2 stage competition against around 60 teams from 20 campuses across europe

### By team Saturday Night Fiverr:

- [Victor Gaugler](https://github.com/vgaugler), [Paul Bouhours](https://github.com/PBouhours), Fabien Bataille, [CÃ©dric La Barthe](https://github.com/cedric-labarthe), [Thomas Allen](https://github.com/teasmade)
- JS Web Development Students
- Wild Code School, Nantes Campus

## The Problem

We were asked to develop an app to improve the experience of Fiverr users and help build their community.

We noted from community research that a lot of new freelancers find it very difficult starting off on fiverr ; the marketplace is crowded, getting your first few reviews is critical and tailoring the fine detail of your offer and contact with potential buyers can make a huge difference in your success.
## Our Solution

Fiverr senpai - a site extending the existing functionality of fiverr.com by providing a mentoring system.

Let enthusiastic new freelancers quickly learn best practice on fiverr by giving them access old hands' knowledge.

Build the community by allying fresh purpose with tried and tested experience.

## App Notes

- This site was coded over a 2.5 day Hackathon.
- Built with React for the front end and Firebase for the back.
- The project was boosted with the help of a template created by [kritika27](https://github.com/kritika27)
- It's Desktop First - responsive styles aren't yet implemented.
